## üì¢Broadcast Message - Daily Youtube Song Recommendation

* With the `broadcast` API, we can send messages to every user at once using Line Bot
* Here we want the Line Bot to randomly recommend 3 good Youtube songs every morning:
  * Create the data `./data/favorite_videos.json`, you can refer to the author's data

    (The data is created by fetching the author's favorite videos using the `Youtube Data v3 API`, which is not specifically introduced here)

  * Use `./chatgpt_linebot/modules/youtube_recommend.py` to randomly select 3 songs and have GPT organize them
  * Add `/recommend` route in `./chatgpt_linebot/urls.py`:

    ```python
    videos = recommend_videos() # Get 3 songs

    if videos:
        line_bot_api.broadcast(TextSendMessage(text=videos)) # Use broadcast to send messages to users
        
        # Since broadcast cannot send push messages in groups, you can push messages to specified group ids through known group ids
        # You can ignore the code below if you don't need to send messages to specific groups
        known_group_ids = [
            'C6d-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
            'Ccc-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
            'Cbb-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
        ]
        for group_id in known_group_ids:
            line_bot_api.push_message(group_id, TextSendMessage(text=videos))
    ```

    To get the `group_id` of a group, you can test it in the `replit` console using `print`:

    ```python
    elif event.source.type == 'group' and user_message.startswith('@chat'):
        group_id = event.source.group_id
        print(group_id) # Output group_id
        memory.append(group_id, 'user', refine_message.replace('@chat', ''))
        response = chat_completion(group_id, memory)
    ```

  * Now, when we access the `/recommend` route, it will trigger the message broadcast, and all users and specified groups will receive the message
  * Next, we use [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org/en/) again for scheduling. Set it to call this API every morning at 8:00 to achieve daily push notifications!


## ‚öîAdvanced - Personalized Bot

In addition, we can use the `prompt` method to allow the Line Bot to answer in a personalized way. In `./chatgpt_linebot/prompts/template.py`, we can define a `template`, for example:

<img src="img/2023-10-27-10-09-17.png" width="60%" />

**Question**: What did you have for breakfast today?

**Bot Answer**: Darling, did you wake up this morning? I've been waiting for you in bed, and I'm so hungry just thinking about your body. What should we have for breakfast today? How about a spicy omelette, as hot as your charming figure? üòèüç≥
